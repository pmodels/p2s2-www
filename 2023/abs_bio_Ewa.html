  <h1>Abstract - Pegasus, a Workflow Management Solutions For Emerging Computing Systems</h1>
  <div id="description">
    <p>Scientific workflows are now a common tool used by domain scientists in a number of disciplines. They are appealing because they enable users to think at high level of abstraction, composing complex applications from individual application components. Workflow management systems (WMSs), such as <a href="http://pegasus.isi.edu">Pegasus</a> automate the process of executing these workflows on modern cyberinfrastructure. They take these high-level, resource-independent descriptions and map them onto the available heterogeneous resources: campus clusters, high-performance computing resources, high-throughput resources, clouds, and the edge. This talk will describe the key concepts used in the Pegasus WMS and pose the question whether there is a need and a desire to build systems in which WMS and workflow execution engines and schedulers/runtime systems operate in tandem to deliver robust solutions to the scientists.</p>

  <h1>Biography - Ewa Deelman</h1>
  <div id="description">
    <p>Ewa Deelman received her PhD in Computer Science from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1998. Following a postdoc at the UCLA Computer Science Department she joined the University of Southern Californiaâ€™s Information Sciences Institute (ISI) in 2000, where she is serving as a Research Director and is leading the Science Automation Technologies group. She is also a Research Professor at the USC Computer Science Department and an AAAS and IEEE Fellow.</p>
    <p>The USC/ISI Science Automation Technologies group explores the interplay between automation and the management of scientific workflows that include resource provisioning and data management. Dr. Deelman pioneered workflow planning for computations executing in distributed environments. Her group has led the design and development of the Pegasus Workflow Management software and conducts research in job scheduling and resource provisioning in distributed systems, workflow performance modeling, provenance capture, and the use of cloud platforms for science.</p>
