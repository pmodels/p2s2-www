  <h1>Abstract - Analysis and optimization of data transfer in Multi-GPU Python applications</h1>
  <div id="description">
    <p>Python is becoming increasingly popular, even in parallel and high-performance computing, although performance is often worse than compiled languages. In our previous work, we looked at Cuda Numba and showed that it can achieve good performance for single kernels. We are now looking at multi-GPU applications that require data exchange. We show that by using stream-aware communication, as enabled by NCCL, performance can be many times better than with MPI, where the Python interpreter poses a significant performance problem.</p>
