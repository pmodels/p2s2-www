  <h1>Abstract - pMEMCPY: Effectively Leveraging Persistent Memory as a Storage Device</h1>
  <div id="description">
    <p>Persistent memory devices offer a dual use technology that can either extend DRAM capacity by offering lower cost load/store access or as persistent storage devices accessible via the memory bus. As NVMe devices have proven, attaining promised performance for persistent memory devices for storage purposes requires special care. Out of the box library and solutions lack proper tuning leaving at least 50% of the potential performance behind. This talk explores some of the special potential for PMEM devices and shows how to effectively use them for high performance storage.</p>
