  <h1>Abstract - Pegasus, a Workflow Management Solutions For Emerging Computing Systems</h1>
  <div id="description">
    <p>Scientific workflows are now a common tool used by domain scientists in a number of disciplines. They are appealing because they enable users to think at high level of abstraction, composing complex applications from individual application components. Workflow management systems (WMSs), such as <a href="http://pegasus.isi.edu">Pegasus</a> automate the process of executing these workflows on modern cyberinfrastructure. They take these high-level, resource-independent descriptions and map them onto the available heterogeneous resources: campus clusters, high-performance computing resources, high-throughput resources, clouds, and the edge. This talk will describe the key concepts used in the Pegasus WMS and pose the question whether there is a need and a desire to build systems in which WMS and workflow execution engines and schedulers/runtime systems operate in tandem to deliver robust solutions to the scientists.</p>
